# Grautamaton (WORK IN PROGRESS - NOT COMPLETED)
General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics reproduced as a Hexagonal Cellular Automata (The Phenomena of Light and Gravity)

# Usability and Versatility
Grautamaton is a supercharged, performance driven, highly configurable Cellular Automata framework for both square and hexagonal cellular tilings. By simply changing the NEIGHBORHOOD variable specified in constants.mjs, one can go from hexagonal neighborhoods, to moore neighborhoods and more!

# Standards and Syntax
Grautmaton uses ES2019 syntax and the mjs module system for extremely concise and elegant code structure and code content

# WebGL 2.0 Compute 
must be enabled by running Chrome with necessary flags as so:

*"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome Beta\Application\chrome.exe" --use-cmd-decoder=passthrough --enable-webgl2-compute-context --use-angle=gl*
